#### Day 1: 2020-03-18

We have decided to avoid lengthy flights and airport crowds for now. A lot of flights are being canceled without notice. 
We flew into Taiwan last night instead and are currently on 14-days home quarantine here. The order of home quarantine now applies to everyone entering Taiwan. Ironically, when waiting to board our flight yesterday, another plane had a burst tire during touchdown. This caused a fire on the airstrip and 2 hours delay in our departure time. Luckily, our flight was not canceled. However, the crowds upon arrival were rather long. We had no issues getting though the passport control but had to wait for 4 hours in the line to get an official taxi. I à hindsight, I think a bus to drop-off everyone to their respective quarantine addresses would have been more efficient. No one has been coughing or sneezing in the line, which is good. Only asymptomatic passengers were allowed to home quarantine and anyone with symptoms was taken to a dedicated hospital facilities. 
Coincidently, our friend who moved to Taiwan from San Francisco and his girlfriend were in Vietnam at the same time as us. We all flew to Taiwan on the same day few hours apart. They helped us to arrange an AirBnB and are helping with groceries delivery as well as keep us in the loop about the latest development of the situation. The information in Chinese is available usually sooner than the translated English version. Though with modern technologies we are able to run google-translate on most web sites. We also got introduced to a friend of Nico’s friend from the university who moved tonTaiwan from France. He has been very positive about Taiwan and the way the country is handling the pandemic. We will have to see how things change since the situation at the moment is far from static.

Overall, we feel safe here and people are nice and seem to be willing to help. Food and basic sanitary items are available in the stores. We are healthy and don’t have any symptoms. Apart from the latest airport transfer, where we took the precautions to avoid contamination, I don’t believe we were exposed to the virus. However, we are diligently monitoring our health and following the quarantine instructions. We both don’t want to risk either getting sick or transmitting the virus to someone else considering how fragile the current situation is.
