#### Day 0 of 14-day Quarantine: 2020-03-19

* At 6:00 am we finally arrived to our quarantine location.
* Slept until 11 am
* Read the news. 
    Taiwan officially canceled an entry to all foreigners. 
    US-Canada border got closed.
    San Francisco and other Bay Area locations annoneced Stay at shelter order.
    US government negotiated extensive relief bill. Not sufficient and debated amoung the experts.
    US governement triggered Level 4 international travel alert. I got scared. Nico stayed positive.
    US and Europe reported 40% of cases are in the age group between 20 and 60. Until now most cases were in older people and people with preconditions. 
* No coffee machine or filters. Luckily we got coffee filter in the Airport in Vietnam for our collection. We also brought with us Vietnamese coffee and chocolate.
    We experimented with Vietnamese coffee. It worked and was delicious. We regretted not buying more.
* Checked ubereats options: a lot, even Carrefour supermarket is nearby. Exciting!
* Attempted to place an order at Carrefour. Unfortnatelly, all other quarantined people decided to do the same. The site couldn't handle the load and went offline. 
* Ubereats still works! Yay. Auto-translate option within the app would have been helpful... At least there are reviews and pictures. Placed an order and waited to be surprised. 
    We were told it is hard to go wrong with the food in Taiwan. Apparently, 40% of the country travel is usually dedicated to food. Fantastic! We can complete 40% of the travel schedule while in quarantine.
* Started to rain and continued to rain for the rest of the day. Perfect weather to stay home.
* Friends quarantined three floors up messeged that they found online grocerries delivery. We provided the shopping list and they placed an order. 
    We felt grateful to have local friends in the foreign country.
* Ubereats arrived. Food was delicious and the quantity was sufficient for the rest of the day. 
* Oksana - started working on the blog to document our travel experience. 
    Nico advised to use jekyll and said it was easy. Apparently his assesment was for the basic site not a beautiful theme and ideas I had in mind. 
    After few hours of tinkering I was frustrated with the progress. More to go.
* Nico - continued to work on his crypto project. He was happy about the progress. 
* Called parents. They were doing well though a bit anxious about the confinement. We told about our escape from Vietnam adventure and mandatory 14-day quarantine routine. They were happy we were safe and less anxious about their confinement. 
* Listened to music. 
* Oksana - continued tinkering with jekyll. Not easy at all.
* Nico - happy with his progress helped me with jekyll to prove his point that it was easy. 
* Got hungry. Continued to explored Taiwan via food. It did not disappoint. Looking forward to ubereats tomorrow.
* Read the news. Nothing good but we feel safe. 
* Went to bed.

#### Day 1 of 14-day Quarantine: 2020-03-20

* Woke up at 8 am and made Vietnamese coffee. The day was gloomy as well but it didn't rain.
* Read the news. 
    27 new cases in Taiwan, total with the virus reached 108, 2nd person died. 
    Panic in US continued. California announced state-wide stay at home order.
* Nico gave me 15 minutes to order Ubereats. I ordered something and established a conversation with the delivery person. Google translator works rather well.
* Zoom call with friends from the three floors up and Seattle. 
    Took a virtual walk in Seattle. It looked better than what we read on the news.
    Shared our experience vising Vietnam. Apparently, we did not miss much:
        Ha Long Bay was beautiful but silent and gloomy.
        Sapa is too crowded, touristy, overbuilt and less picturesque in its raw, unedited state that we iamgined it would be from instagrammed imagines.
        Our little island stay was a good choice.
* Ubereats arrived. The food was delicious again. Little pastry with bean paste was particularly flavourable. 
* Our friends from three floors up messafed that the owner of the appartment called and asked not to go out to pick up deliveries. He would bring the food to us once it arrives. The neighbors complained. 
* We continued to work on our projects.
    I reiterated that jekyll was not easy. 
    Nico was happy with his progress. 
* Our grocerries arrived. California milk and USA oranges reminded home. It's easy to get nostalgic in the wake of crisis and ignore the intransic damage to the environment from shipping milk all this distance. I though Taiwan had their own cows and oranges.
* Read the news. 
    Taiwan extended visa to 30 more days. We can now stay in the country for 120 days total. 
        What about typhoon season that starts in June and recurring > 5 magnitude earthquakes that happen few times a month? Is geopolitical situation a concern? What about level 4 travel alert?.. Nico stayed positive about the prospects and we moved on.
    Italy death toll surpassed that of China. 
        Newspaper articles started to question open democracy. I was annoyed. 
* Called parents again. They were doing well. 
* Made tea and had it with Vietnamese choclate. Best chocolate we had in a while, as good as Dandelion chocolate from San Francisco but cheaper. We regretting not having purchased more. 
* Continued to work ont the jekyll. 
* Ordered Ubereats for dinner: noodles and rice. 
* Finally made image captions to work. Nico said it looked good.
* Went to bed. We have zoom at 9 am with our friends tomorrow. No wonder zoom shares are doing well.

#### Day 2 of 14-day Quarantine: 2020-03-20

* Woke up at 8:50 am and started coffee.
* Called into zoom. 
    The cattle was making noise and Nico moved it into the bathroom.
    The rest of the friends joined. It was good to see everyone. 
    We exchange the latest news and gave their opiniion on the situation. 
    We shared our story of escaping to Taiwan.
    Everyone is working from home. Some hiring is going on which was good news.
    Too bad free version of zoom allows only 40 min of interupted conversion. We had to reconnect three times. 
* Read the news.
    US announced that the tax filing deadline is in July instead of April.
    8 new cases in Taiwan, all imported. Total worldwide reached 263,699 cases with 11183 death toll. This is almost 30k more new cases than yesterday. 
    Madagascar announced 3 cases of virus. They have made decision to stop all international travel as of March 20 on March 18th. At the time there were no covid cases in the country. I guess we are not going to Madagascar in May.
    Ukraine registered 40 new cases, 3 people died. Most cases are in Western Ukraine. I got anxious.
* Nico made delicious breakfast. Today is sunny. We decided it eat on the balcony. 
    Air pollution was surprisingly high (marked as Very high)
* Zoom meeting with my parents and sister. 
    Ukraine is locked down with all non-essential businesses are shut down. 
    My mom was planning to go one last time to the pool. We were able to persuade her to stay home.
* Made tea and enjoyed it with chocolate and cookies. Sun moon lake tea - keeps our spirits high.
* Ordered Ubereats.
* Attempted work on jekyll. I have not been productive today.
* Called Nico's parents. They are well but concerned with the rise in the death toll in Italy and France. They stay home and keep themselves busy.
* Ubereats arrived. It was good. I think we should try a different restaurant next time.
* Checked the latest stats: 41k+ total infected in Italy, 276k total globally.
